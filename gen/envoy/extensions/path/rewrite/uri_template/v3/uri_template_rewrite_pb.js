/**
 * Indicates that during forwarding, portions of the path that match the
 * pattern should be rewritten, even allowing the substitution of variables
 * from the match pattern into the new path as specified by the rewrite template.
 * This is useful to allow application paths to be
 * rewritten in a way that is aware of segments with variable content like
 * identifiers. The router filter will place the original path as it was
 * before the rewrite into the :ref:`x-envoy-original-path
 * <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-original-path>` header.
 *
 * Only one of :ref:`prefix_rewrite <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.prefix_rewrite>`,
 * :ref:`regex_rewrite <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.regex_rewrite>`,
 * or *path_template_rewrite* may be specified.
 *
 * Template pattern matching types:
 *
 * * ``*`` : Matches a single path component, up to the next path separator: /
 *
 * * ``**`` : Matches zero or more path segments. If present, must be the last operator.
 *
 * * ``{name} or {name=*}`` :  A named variable matching one path segment up to the next path separator: /.
 *
 * * ``{name=videos/*}`` : A named variable matching more than one path segment.
 *      The path component matching videos/* is captured as the named variable.
 *
 * * ``{name=**}`` : A named variable matching zero or more path segments.
 *
 * Only named matches can be used to perform rewrites.
 *
 * Examples using path_template_rewrite:
 *
 * * The pattern ``/{one}/{two}`` paired with a substitution string of ``/{two}/{one}`` would
 *   transform ``/cat/dog`` into ``/dog/cat``.
 *
 * * The pattern ``/videos/{language=lang/*}/*`` paired with a substitution string of
 *   ``/{language}`` would transform ``/videos/lang/en/video.m4s`` into ``lang/en``.
 *
 * * The path pattern ``/content/{format}/{lang}/{id}/{file}.vtt`` paired with a substitution
 *   string of ``/{lang}/{format}/{file}.vtt`` would transform ``/content/hls/en-us/12345/en_193913.vtt``
 *   into ``/en-us/hls/en_193913.vtt``.
