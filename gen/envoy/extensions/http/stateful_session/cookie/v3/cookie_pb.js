/**
 * This extension allows the session state to be tracked via cookies.
 *
 * This extension first encodes the address of the upstream host selected by the load balancer
 * into a ``set-cookie`` response header with the :ref:`cookie configuration
 * <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.http.stateful_session.cookie.v3.CookieBasedSessionState.cookie>`.
 * when new requests are incoming, this extension will try to parse the specific upstream host
 * address by the cookie name. If the address parsed from the cookie corresponds to a valid
 * upstream host, this upstream host will be selected first. See :ref:`stateful session filter
 * <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.stateful_session.v3.StatefulSession>`.
 *
 * For example, if the cookie name is set to ``sticky-host``, envoy will prefer ``1.2.3.4:80``
 * as the upstream host when the request contains the following header:
 *
 * .. code-block:: none
 *
 *     cookie: sticky-host="MS4yLjMuNDo4MA=="
 *
 * When processing the upstream response, if ``1.2.3.4:80`` is indeed the final choice the extension
 * does nothing. If ``1.2.3.4:80`` is not the final choice, the new selected host will be used to
 * update the cookie (via the ``set-cookie`` response header).
