/**
 * Configuration for getaddrinfo DNS resolver. This resolver will use the system's getaddrinfo()
 * function to resolve hosts.
 *
 * .. attention::
 *
 *   This resolver uses a single background thread to do resolutions. As such, it is not currently
 *   advised for use in situations requiring a high resolution rate. A thread pool can be added
 *   in the future if needed.
 *
 * .. attention::
 *
 *   Resolutions currently use a hard coded TTL of 60s because the getaddrinfo() API does not
 *   provide the actual TTL. Configuration for this can be added in the future if needed.
