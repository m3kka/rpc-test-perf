 * Configuration for the SkipFilter match action. When matching results in this action, the
 * associated filter will be ignored for all filter callbacks (e.g. ``encodeHeaders``, ``encodeData``,
 * etc. for HTTP filters) after the matcher arrives at the match, including the callback that
 * caused the match result. For example, when used with a HTTP filter and the match result was
 * resolved after receiving the HTTP response headers, the HTTP filter will *not* receive the
 * response header callback.
 *
 * As a result, if this match action is resolved before the first filter callback (e.g. HTTP request
 * headers), the filter will be completely skipped.
