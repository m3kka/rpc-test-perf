/**
 * The Dlb is a hardware managed system of queues and arbiters connecting producers and consumers. It is a PCIE device
 * in the CPU package. It interacts with software running on cores and potentially other devices. The Dlb implements the
 * following balancing features:
 *
 * -  Lock-free multi-producer/multi-consumer operation.
 * -  Multiple priorities for varying traffic types.
 * -  Various distribution schemes.
 *
 * Dlb connection balancer uses Dlb hardware to balance connections, and can significantly reduce latency.
 *
 * As the Dlb connection balancer provides assistance from dedicated Dlb hardware, it can be used for a proxy with a large number of connections
 * (e.g., a gateway).
